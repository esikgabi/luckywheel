# LuckyWheel

LuckyWheel can be described as a lucky wheel application designed to determine who among a group of friends should undertake a task. This task might be favorable or not so much.

In our friend group, we used an application like this to decide who would carry out a certain task or who would face a penalty. However, shortcomings in that application inspired me to create my own.
